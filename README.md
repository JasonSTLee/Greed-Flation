The purpose of this project is to figure out if the [largest retail grocery stores](https://www.foodindustry.com/articles/top-10-grocers-in-the-united-states-2019/#gsc.tab=0) are inflating their prices, a term coined as ['greed-flation'](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/what-is-greedflation-and-is-it-driving-higher-prices/)


**Tech used:** Python (libraries include Pandas, OS, Matplotlib, and Alpha Vantage)

Code and analysis can be found in the file [alpha_api.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/JasonSTLee/Greed-Flation/blob/main/alpha_api.ipynb)
